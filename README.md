# COVID Vaccine Tracker
This project was created to asses when US states would reach 80% vaccination and their overall vaccine progress.\
The code pulls from vaccine databases as factors in State Population.\
This was made back in March of 2021 but could see modification for future use with the COVID Delta Variant. \
The predictions for 80% didn't quite work out as the curve went logarithimic at about 50% which was earlier than expetced, but until that point it provided fairly vaccine predictions.
